# Data_Science

In this section I will be investigating on a certain case study using machine learning libraries, namely skLearn and TensorFlow.

The pipeline of these machine learning projects are:
1. Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Modelling and Hyperparameter Tunings
5. Training-Test Validation (Scoring)
